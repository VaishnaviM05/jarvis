The Jarvis AI Voice Assistant project aims to create a basic yet functional voice-activated assistant inspired by the
fictional AI assistant, Jarvis, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This project will involve developing a voice-controlled
application that can perform a range of tasks such as answering questions, setting reminders, providing weather updates,
and managing basic functions of a computer or mobile device.
· Project Overview: The project focuses on developing ”Jarvis,” an AI voice assistant inspired by the fictional assistant
from Iron Man. It aims to provide users with voice-controlled interactions to perform various tasks.
· Core Functionalities: Jarvis can understand and respond to natural language commands, perform web searches, manage
schedules, control smart home devices, and provide real-time information such as weather updates and news.
· Technology Stack: The project leverages technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding and
generating human-like responses, speech recognition for converting voice to text, and text-to-speech synthesis for providing
vocal responses.
· User Interaction: Users interact with Jarvis through a microphone, issuing voice commands. The assistant processes these
commands, executes the necessary actions, and provides vocal feedback, creating a seamless hands-free experience.
